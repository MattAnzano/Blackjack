# Blackjack
Provides a single player, command line based game of Blackjack. 

The motivation behind this game was for educational purposes. At the time of this development
I was learning the language of python, and decided to tackle a more complex project(at the time). 

The game is simple and runs from the command line, allowing a single user to play against a computer.
Simply follow the instructions on the screen.

The game executes from "Game.py" simply run this file in the command line with the supporting class files in
an accesable path and you have your game.

-enjoy!
